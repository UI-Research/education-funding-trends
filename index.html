    How has education funding changed over time? 
    <hr class="title"/>
  </div>

  <div class="main-text">
    <p>Elementary and secondary education is funded through a complex mix of federal, state, and local dollars. How that funding has changed over time depends on local economies, legislative decisions, and in many cases court orders. This tool examines where education funding has—and has not—changed the most.</p>
    <p>To understand how school funding has changed we look both at the level of funding over time and at the changes in <a href="http://apps.urban.org/features/school-funding-do-poor-kids-get-fair-share/" target="_blank">funding progressivity</a>, or how much more is spent on educating low-income students relative to nonpoor students. (Our default is to compare states using cost-adjusted dollars based on the salaries of college graduates in each district, but you can turn that adjustment off using the checkbox below.) Though education funding has generally increased and become more progressive, states vary widely in how much money they spend on education and how they distribute that money. </p>
    <p>Below, you can explore how local, state, and federal funding has changed over the past two decades. The chart to the left shows the national average, and clicking a state will add its trend line to the chart so you can compare. If you want to look only at one type of funding—state-level, for example, you can turn the different funding sources on or off. </p>

        Overall school funding is about as progressive today, on average, as it was in 1995. In that time, six states increased in progressivity by at least 5 percentage points, while only two states became regressive.

      We measured the progressivity of school funding as a ratio. A ratio of 1.0 means funding is equal for poor and non-poor students; a number above one means funding is progressive; a number below one means funding is regressive. An estimate of 1.1, for example, would imply that on average poor students attend districts that receive 10 percent more in per-student funding than the districts nonpoor students attend.
