"Overall education funding has increased over the past 20 years, though it has declined, on average, since 2009. In that time [STATE] experienced the most growth while [STATE] declined.","Nationwide the combination of state and local funding increased, on average, between 1995 and 2015. Local funding comes from property taxes while state funding comes from the state's general fund. ","Because federal funding accounts for less than 10 percent of school funding, the trend lines here more or less mirror the trends in local funding alone.  ","Because federal funding accounts for less than 10 percent of school funding and affects most states in similar ways, the trend lines here more or less mirror the trends in state funding alone. State funding comes from the general fund and distributed through formulas that vary by state. Federal funding comes to states primarily through programs designed to reach low-income students, or students with disabilities.","Federal funding accounts for less than 10 percent of total school funding. The largest federal funding programs are Title I, which directs money to districts serving a lot of low-income students and child nutrition programs. The federal government also provides money to districts that serve students with disabilities, offer bilingual education programs, or are located on Indian lands. Federal funding spiked in 2010 with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ","At the local level, education funding comes largely from property taxes. Most states experienced a gradual increase in local funding, though in some cases policy changes caused local funding levels to drop. ","State funding comes from each stateÍs general fund. Nationwide, state funding has increased by [x]% over the past 20 years, but those changes have been felt unevenly. VermontÍs funding, for example, increased [x]%, while FloridaÍs state education funding actually declined.","Overall school funding is about as progressive today, on average, as it was in 1995. In that time, six states increased in progressivity by at least 5 percentage points, while only two states became regressive. ","State funding formulas are generally designed to balance out regressive local funding formulas. Local funding comes largely from property taxes, while state funding comes from sales and income taxes. ","Looking at the combination of local and federal funding doesn't reveal much, because state funding is designed to fill in the gaps local funding creates.  ","The combination of state and federal funding is generally progressive. Almost all state funding formulas almost all attempt to divide funding in a progressive way, while federal funding is inherently progressive, with the largest federal funding programs, Title I and child nutrition programs, specifically designed to direct money to districts serving low-income students","Federal funding accounts for less than 10 percent of total school funding. Federal funding is inherently progressive, with the largest federal funding programs, Title I and child nutrition programs, specifically designed to direct money to districts serving low-income students. The federal government also provides money to districts that serve students with disabilities, offer bilingual education programs, or are located on Indian lands. ","At the local level, education funding comes largely from property taxes. We expect local funding to be regressive, given that districts with mostly nonpoor students tend to have more local dollars coming in, and therefore more money to spend, than districts with many poor students.","Each state has its own funding formula to distribute money from the general fund, but almost all attempt to divide funding in a progressive way. Whether they succeed in doing so depends on the specifics of the formula and on the way districts are divided. In states with large, homogenous districts, for example, it is difficult to target money to districts serving low-income students.  "
