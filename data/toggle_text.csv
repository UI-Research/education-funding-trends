The largest federal funding programs are Title I, which directs money to low-income students, and child nutrition programs. The federal government also provides money to districts that serve students with disabilities, offer bilingual education programs, or are located on Indian lands. Federal funding spiked in 2010 with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (commonly known as the stimulus). ","Federal funding accounts for less than 10 percent of all school funding.
